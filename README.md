# userManagement
This is an angular project having application of NGRX in it.
Here I have created an angular application where I have implemented an User Management behaviour and Role Based Menu.
New user can create their account and then only can login.
Admin will have privilege to update the role of user.
Few menu will be available only to admin.
Every logic has been completely based on NGRX.
